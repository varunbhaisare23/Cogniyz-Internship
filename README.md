# Cogniyz-Internship
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of a global restaurant dataset to uncover key insights into the food industry. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn, I performed data cleaning, geographical mapping, and advanced statistical analysis to understand the factors that drive restaurant success and customer satisfaction.

📊 Key Insights & Visualizations
1. The Price-Quality Correlation
Insight: We observed a direct linear relationship between price range and aggregate ratings. Luxury restaurants (Price Range 4) consistently maintain higher ratings compared to budget eateries.

Finding: While budget restaurants dominate in volume (46.5%), they have the highest volatility in ratings, suggesting that luxury establishments offer more consistent service quality.

2. Service Availability & Market Trends
Insight: Table booking is a "premium-only" feature, whereas Online Delivery is a mass-market strategy.

Finding: Only 0.02% of budget restaurants offer table bookings, compared to 46.8% of luxury restaurants. However, Online Delivery peaks in the mid-range (Category 2 & 3), suggesting these restaurants focus on high-turnover convenience.

3. Geographical Clustering
Insight: Restaurant density is heavily concentrated in specific urban "hotspots," which correlate with higher competition and higher average ratings.

Finding: Using Latitude and Longitude analysis, we identified that restaurants in central business districts are 25% more likely to have a rating above 4.0 compared to suburban outliers.

4. Popularity vs. Satisfaction
Insight: High volume (Votes) does not always equal high quality (Rating).

Finding: A moderate positive correlation (0.31) exists between votes and ratings. The data density shows a massive "silent" group of restaurants with 0 ratings and 0 votes, representing a significant market gap for new business growth.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium

Tools: Google Colab, VS Code, GitHub

📊 Key Insights Discovered
Price vs. Rating: A clear positive correlation exists between higher price ranges and better aggregate ratings.

Service Impact: Restaurants offering online delivery tend to have higher engagement (votes) and slightly higher ratings than those that don't.

City Dominance: New Delhi holds the highest volume of restaurants, but smaller cities like "Inner City" often boast higher average quality ratings.


📝 Conclusion
Through this 3-level analysis, I demonstrated that pricing strategy and service features (Online Delivery/Table Booking) are the strongest predictors of a restaurant's rating. For a restaurant to be successful in the current market, mid-range pricing combined with online delivery offers the best balance of volume and customer satisfaction.
