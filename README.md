# Cogniyz-Internship
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of a global restaurant dataset to uncover key insights into the food industry. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn, I performed data cleaning, geographical mapping, and advanced statistical analysis to understand the factors that drive restaurant success and customer satisfaction.

🚀 Key Technical Tasks Performed
Data Exploration & Cleaning: Handled missing values, optimized data types, and prepared the dataset for analysis.

Descriptive Analysis: Identified the top-performing cuisines (North Indian, Chinese, Fast Food) and analyzed restaurant distributions across major cities.

Geospatial Analysis: Used Latitude and Longitude coordinates to map restaurant clusters and identify business "hotspots."

Feature Correlation: Investigated the relationship between Price Ranges and services like Table Booking (showing that luxury restaurants are 45% more likely to offer reservations).

Sentiment & Popularity Analysis: Explored how Vote Volume correlates with Aggregate Ratings, using Hexbin plots to visualize data density.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium

Tools: Google Colab, VS Code, GitHub

📊 Key Insights Discovered
Price vs. Rating: A clear positive correlation exists between higher price ranges and better aggregate ratings.

Service Impact: Restaurants offering online delivery tend to have higher engagement (votes) and slightly higher ratings than those that don't.

City Dominance: New Delhi holds the highest volume of restaurants, but smaller cities like "Inner City" often boast higher average quality ratings.
